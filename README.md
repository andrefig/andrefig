    # Professional
    I studied ***Control & Automation Engineering*** :robot: at UFRJ from 2008 to 2013. As a conclusion project I simmulated and made an Insulated ZVS DC-DC Converter.   <br/>
		From 2011 to 2013 I worked with database and  data visualization, automating SLA calculation at a consulting company. Later I founded an home automation business with my father, and developed products and production infrastructure (eg.: small scale pick-and-place machine, infrared soldering control...) <br/>
		I've obtained MSc. on Electrical Engineering in 2015 developing a BMS - Battery Management System :battery:. <br/> 
		Nowadays I'm researching for my DSc (***Probabilistic Filtering / Target Tracking***) and working as an Electronic Engineer in the Brazilian Navy :anchor: Research Center (Underwater Accoustics Research Group). <br/> 
    I'm also Studing ***Ruby on Rails*** (that's why I'm here)

    # Hobby    
   In the free time I like cycling :bicyclist: (and bike repairing :wrench: ), beach :beach_umbrella:, brewing beer (I've made a nice automatic RIMS using CraftBeerPi) and electronics DIY projects. I love to be with my fiance :cupid:, family :family_man_woman_boy_boy: and friends, and enjoying nice restaurants, wine :wine_glass: and beer with them.
   <br/>
   I enjoy a lot reading, mostly History :european_castle:, Philosophy of History , Religion (I'm a Roman Catholic :latin_cross:) and related Literature.
